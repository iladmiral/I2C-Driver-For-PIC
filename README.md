# PIC-Drivers
Drivers (**I2C**, **SPI**, **UART**) for *PIC16F877A* and Other Similar PIC MCUs | [MPLAB X IDE](https://www.microchip.com/mplab/mplab-x-ide)

This is a basic PIC drivers ready to use for series bus connections, tested in simulation ([Proteus](https://www.labcenter.com/downloads/) | Simulations [I2C](https://github.com/iladmiral/Simulation-Circuit/tree/master/I2C), [SPI](https://github.com/iladmiral/Simulation-Circuit/tree/master/SPI), [UART](https://github.com/iladmiral/Simulation-Circuit/tree/master/UART)) & in real prototyping (Pkit3). 
In order to make simple each folder contains two directory Master & Salve which contains two files (main.c, Config.h)
___
# Config.h
File generated by MPLAB X v5.30, could be used directly or just copy the configuration bits.
*Important disable the Watchdog Timer.*
 
```c
// CONFIG
// Oscillator Selection bits (XT oscillator)
#pragma config FOSC = XT 
```
```c
// Watchdog Timer Enable bit (WDT disabled)
#pragma config WDTE = OFF
```
```c
// Power-up Timer Enable bit (PWRT enabled)
#pragma config PWRTE = ON
```
```c
// Brown-out Reset Enable bit (BOR enabled)
#pragma config BOREN = ON
```
```c
// Low-Voltage (Single-Supply) In-Circuit Serial Programming Enable bit (RB3 is digital I/O, HV on MCLR must be used for programming)
#pragma config LVP = OFF
```
```c
// Data EEPROM Memory Code Protection bit (Data EEPROM code protection off)
#pragma config CPD = OFF
```
```c
// Flash Program Memory Write Enable bits (Write protection off; all program memory may be written to by EECON control)
#pragma config WRT = OFF
```
```c
// Flash Program Memory Code Protection bit (Code protection off)
#pragma config CP = OFF
```         
___
# TO DO:
1. Test building with only makefile.
2. Make pattren to support lot of situations.
